# make-pot.cfg - sample configuration file for the {PackageName} package.

# This file is used to configure make-pot.sh, which creates a .pot file for a
# shell script that includes--either directly or indirectly in a sourced file--
# a function named i18n_table.  make-pot.sh runs xgettext.sh and GNU gettext.

# This configuration file should be prepared by a programmer.
# Adapt this file for your own project.  Take what you need.

# Fatdog64 Linux: this sample configuration is suitable for a generic ROX-App
# that includes some shell scripts and possibly mdview-flavored markdown files.

# --- Required project settings ------------------------------------------

# Typically, this file resides in my development directory under
# usr/share/doc/{PackageName}/nls/cfg

# --from-code=$IENC -L Shell) Anchor relative paths to /usr/
XSRC=../../../../../usr/bin/{PackageName}
# --no-location is highly recommended to reduce diff friction
XOPT="-ci18n --no-location"

# Then $XTBL source file is scanned for MSGIDs with $XXGT (default
# --from-code=$IENC -L Shell) Anchor relative paths to /usr/
XTBL=../../../../../usr/bin/{PackageName}
XXGT=./xgettext.sh
# --no-location is highly recommended to reduce diff friction
